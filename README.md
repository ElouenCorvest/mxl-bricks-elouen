# MxlBricks-Elouen

This Fork includes all the side projects that Elouen Corvest has created for the mxlbricks package.


## Development setup

Run `pixi install -e dev` in this directory. This will install the `dev` package. Then to install this local `mxlbricks` as editable, you just need to run `pixi run -e dev dev-install`.
